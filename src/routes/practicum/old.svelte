			<h2>Synthesis</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					For the first part of my practicum, I had to take online courses in LinkedIn Learning.
					Through the courses, I have learned various soft skills that would help me as a future
					software engineer.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the design thinking module, I have learned what it takes to create innovative
					solutions. From the courses, I learned that innovation starts with critical thinking. As
					defined by Mike Figliuolo, one of the instructors of the courses, critical thinking is the
					ability to think of the correct decision given bottlenecks, problems, and limited time.
					Critical thinking is one of the main components of creativity. As defined by Stefan Mumaw,
					creativity is the ability to create solutions that are both novel and relevant. However,
					being creative is not enough in the industry. We must also put our creative ideas into
					practice by being innovative.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the project management module, I have learned the process of how to turn ideas into
					reality. The undertaking of turning an idea to reality is called a project. More formally,
					a project is a temporary endeavor that has a specific and unique goal, and usually a
					budget. There are typically two methods for managing projects. There is the traditional
					way of project management, and there is agile project management. For software projects,
					agile project management is usually used as it enables the team to quickly deliver value
					and change depending on the needs of the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the workplace management module, I have learned how I should act in the workplace.
					The module covers three primary skills. The first is communication in the workplace.
					Through the courses, I learned how to communicate better with other people. In addition to
					this, I have learned the proper etiquette when calling, emailing, and texting. The second
					skill I have learned to improve is time management. Through the courses. I have learned
					how to maximize my calendar, and I have learned ways to balance work and personal time.
					Lastly, the module has helped me be more productive. I have learned that productivity goes
					hand in hand with time management. The better you are at time management, the more
					productive you are. In addition to this, I have learned better ways and better tools to
					keep track of tasks that I need to accomplish.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, the experience of improving my soft skills through LinkedIn learning brought a
					fresh perspective. As a software engineer, soft skills are often overlooked as there is so
					much to learn in our field. Soft skills are either overlooked or ignored so we often get
					stuck in our own ways. However, through these modules, I have been able to gain new
					perspectives, tools, and techniques to improve my soft skills.

				<p>
					In the second part of my practicum, I had to get my IBM DevOps and Software Engineering
					Professional Certificate through Coursera. In this professional certification, I learned
					what it takes to be a modern software engineer. The topics that I have learned range from
					software engineering, DevOps, practices, and tools.
				</p>
				<p>
					One huge focus of the professional certificate was on DevOps. To understand DevOps, we
					must first understand what Agile development is. As defined by John Rofrano, the
					instructor of the professional certificate, agile development is an iterative approach to
					development done by responsive teams whose purpose is to deliver value to the customer
					faster. DevOps on the other hand is the extension of the agile development environment to
					operations that aims to change the process of software delivery. The DevOps methodology
					tears down organizational silos including development and operations to enable the
					organization to deliver the software to the user in the best way possible. Through this
					organizations can leverage and enable disruptive technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					The professional certificate also covered Software Engineering. Topics that were discussed
					include the software development lifecycle, the basics of programming, and software
					architecture design and patterns. While I am already quite familiar with these concepts,
					the certificate was able to refresh my knowledge of the basics of Software Engineering.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to learning what software engineering and DevOps are, I have also learned the
					technologies that enable teams to create highly effective software. One of these is using
					Cloud technology. By using cloud technology, the hardware could be easily scaled up and
					down both horizontally and vertically all without needing to worry about the physical
					hardware. Another technology discussed is the use of containerization technology.
					Containers allow software to be run anywhere. Using a container orchestration tool like
					Kubernetes, software could scale up and down both horizontally and vertically.
				</p>
				<p>
					Combining cloud and containerization technology allows both the hardware and software to
					scale. To fully leverage this capability, the microservices software architecture is used.
					Microservices is an approach to creating an application composed of many smaller services
					that are loosely coupled, independently deployable, and small. By decomposing software
					into smaller services, each service could be scaled and developed independently. An added
					benefit of this approach is that when one service fails, the others are not affected. The
					program must simply kill the container with the service and start a new one. Replica Sets
					also allow the service to have multiple instances of a service running which could take
					over the failing service, thus making the failure invisible to the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					In developing microservice applications, there are various practices that are used to
					ensure high-quality software. One of these is test-driven development (TDD) and
					behavior-driven development (BDD). TDD is the practice of writing a test first for code
					you wish you have, then writing the code to make the tests pass. This ensures that the
					code you are writing is working as expected and ensures future changes don’t break the
					code. BDD on the other hand describes the behavior of the system from the perspective of
					the user. This makes BDD great for integration testing. Both are needed to create
					high-quality software because BDD ensures that you are building the right things and TDD
					ensures that you are building the thing right.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another practice done to ensure high quality software is Continuous Integration (CI) and
					Continuous Delivery (CD). Continuous integration is an automated process that allows
					developers to integrate their work into a repository. A CI pipeline automatically runs
					jobs such as building, testing, linting, security scanning. The pipeline ensures that the
					code is working and is of high quality all the time. On the other hand, continuous
					delivery is an automated process that deploys integrated code into a production-like
					environment. These processes are important to reduce integration risk, increase code
					quality, reduce deployment time, and enable faster reaction time to change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another practice done by software engineers that I have learned is measuring and
					monitoring. Measuring is the process of collecting metrics. On the other hand, monitoring
					is the process of keeping track of whether the metrics are within a certain threshold.
					This is important because, as explained by John Rofrano, you cannot improve what you
					cannot measure. These metrics are used to reason and judge the success of your progress. I
					have also learned how important it is to differentiate between vanity and actionable
					metrics. As software engineers, we must take actionable metrics and not vanity metrics.
					While vanity metrics may look appealing, they provide no insight into how the system is
					working. Instead, we should focus on actionable metrics because these produce value if we
					act on them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, I have also learned about the various tools used by modern software developers.
					These tools include Git and GitHub which are used for collaborating on code with other
					developers. Another tool that was introduced was the Linux shell. The Linux shell is used
					to manage files and the operating system. It is also important to learn as many developer
					tools have a command line interface accessible through the Linux shell. Additionally, I
					was also able to learn to use ZenHub which is an agile project management tool that allows
					you to keep track of user stories.
				</p>
				<p>
					All in all, taking the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional certificate has
					given me comprehensive knowledge of what it takes to be a modern software engineer. These
					include the tools, practices, and technology that enable software engineers to create
					high-quality and highly effective software.

					In the final part of my practicum, I had to take three courses in Metacrafters. These
					courses include a beginner JavaScript course, a beginner Solidity course, and an
					intermediate Solidity and Avalanche course.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first course I took was the beginner course on JavaScript. Since I am already familiar
					with JavaScript, the course was mostly a review for me. However, despite this, I was able
					to pick up a couple of new things about the JavaScript programming language such as type
					coercion. All in all, the course was a good refresher on programming with JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second course I took was the beginner solidity course. The course was mostly a review
					because I have already done some development of solidity in the past. However, despite
					being familiar with solidity, I still found a couple of new things to learn about the
					language. The course ended with a project where I needed to create a smart contract that
					allows users to mint and burn coins. Overall, I gained a deeper understanding of the
					syntax of solidity through this course.
				</p>
				<p>
					The third and final course was the intermediate Solidity and Avalanche course. The course
					discussed more advanced topics in the Solidity programming language such as functions,
					proxy contracts, and front-end integration. The course also discussed fallback and payable
					functions, abstract contracts and interfaces, ERC Contracts, and deploying contracts to
					the Avalanche C Chain.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have also created four projects for the intermediate solidity and avalanche course. For
					the first project, I created a smart contract called MetaTrivia which is a trivia game on
					the blockchain where users gain points by creating and answering trivia. For the second
					project, I created a smart contract that allows pharmacists to verify the authenticity of
					prescriptions created by doctors. For the third project of the course, I created a token
					called job-coin that allows the user to get their balance, mint coins, burn coins, and
					transfer coins to another account. For the final project of the course, I created an ERC20
					token called Degen Token.
				</p>
				<p>
					All in all, taking the Metacrafters was a great opportunity to learn more about blockchain
					technology. At the start, I thought that I was not going to learn much since I already had
					experience with developing blockchain technology. To my surprise, I was able to learn a
					lot more, and I have gained a deeper appreciation of how blockchain technology could be
					useful. Moreover, I was also able to create projects that demonstrate my knowledge and
					skills in blockchain technology.

		<h1>Overall Synthesis</h1>
		<p>
			My practicum was primary divided in three parts. The first part was my required modules that I
			had to take in LinkedIn Learning. The second part was the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering
			professional certificate which I had to take in Coursera. The third and final parts were the
			three modules I had to take in Metacrafters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through the three parts of my practicum. I have also learned a lot of new knowledge and skills
			that I can apply once I am in the workplace. Through my required modules, I have learned how
			to improve my soft skills including my creativity, critical thinking, project management, and
			time management. I have learned more about software engineering and DevOps through my
			professional certificate. I have also learned more about blockchain and smart contracts
			throughout the course in Metacrafters.
		</p>
		<p>
			These skills and knowledge would be especially useful for me once I become a part of the
			workforce as a Junior Software Engineer. For example, as a software engineer, I will be
			working in a team, and creativity, critical thinking, and communication will be especially
			useful. The practices and technologies such as test-driven development, CI/CD, and
			microservices will be especially useful as these are commonly used in the industry. Learning
			about blockchain and smart contracts also opens more possibilities for innovation and
			employment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through the courses, I have also realized how much more there is to learn. Most of these, we
			will not be able to learn just by following instructions and watching video lectures. These
			could only be learned by experiencing them and by actually doing them. However, despite the
			overwhelming amount of untapped knowledge out there, I am more confident in my skills, and I
			now have a better idea of which areas I need to improve on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also honestly did not expect that learning the modules would be as hard as it was. At first,
			I thought that if I just need to make some time to watch the modules, I would be doing fine.
			However, I quickly realized that just allocating time for watching the modules is not enough
			since I also had to absorb the lessons from the modules. By rushing through the modules, I was
			able to get a lot done, but I couldn’t learn as much as I want to.
		</p>
		<p>
			From this experience, I learned how important it is to pace yourself when you are doing work.
			While it may be tempting to accomplish work all in one go, this increases the risk of having
			low-quality outputs. In addition to this, I also realized that pacing work improves health. By
			allocating time, I was able to avoid burning out and I was able to make time for self-care.
		</p>
		<p>
			All in all, I found the experience of doing this practicum an eye-opener. It opened my eyes to
			new practices, technologies, and tools. I was able to gain a deeper understanding of these
			through the courses I have taken. Most importantly, my eyes were also opened to the areas I
			could improve to become a complete Software Engineer.
